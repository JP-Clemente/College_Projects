# College Projects
This repository contain some of my most relevant work during programming subjects at my college, mainly made using C and C++ language. Some of the coding you'll find here have some complexity and involve some advanced concepts of programming. As you chose a project, there will be an explanation inside it's folder on how to compile it and how it works.

## These projects include:
- Basic programming concepts: conditionals, loops, functions, recursivity and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Operator overloading
- Templates
- Data structures
