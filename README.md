# Programming_Projects
This repository includes some of my most relevant work during programming subjects at my college, mostly made using C and C++ language. Some of the coding you'll find here have some complexity and involve some advanced concepts of programming. As you chose a project there will be an explanation inside it's folder on how to compile it and how it works.

## These projects include:

- Basic programming concepts: conditionals, loops, functions, recursivity and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Data structures
